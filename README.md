## Minimalistic Linux Terminal Simulator on Arduino

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a minimalistic Linux terminal simulator using an Arduino board. The terminal simulator will mimic basic functionalities of a Linux terminal, allowing users to execute simple commands and view output on a connected display. This project is ideal for educational purposes, demonstrating basic concepts of operating systems, command-line interfaces, and embedded systems.

## Features

- **Basic Command Execution:** Execute simple Linux commands (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`).
- **Command Parsing:** Parse and interpret user input.
- **Serial Communication:** Interact with the terminal via the Arduino's serial interface.
- **Output Display:** Show command output on a connected display (e.g., LCD or OLED).
- **Error Handling:** Basic error messages for unknown commands or incorrect usage.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, Nano)
- LCD/OLED display module (compatible with Arduino)
- USB cable for programming and power
- Breadboard and jumper wires (optional for easier connections)

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Arduino libraries for the display module (e.g., LiquidCrystal for LCD, Adafruit_SSD1306 for OLED)
